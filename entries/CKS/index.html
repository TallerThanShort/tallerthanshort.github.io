    <h1>I'm Leaving CKS</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>So, you've heard the news... I'm leaving CKS<br>
        This blog entry will hopefully clarify what exactly that means.<br>
        CKS was a small team of people, joined together by Chawi Mi. The team dates as far back as early 2018 (as far as I know), and I was
        the last member invited while Chawi was around.<br>
        The team mainly consisted of 8 members, but the whole og team can be found <a href="https://smithcharlie499.wixsite.com/ckstudios-canada/information">here</a>
        <b>(idk what the site looks like in 2022, the last time I looked it was 2019)</b><br><br>
        Back to why I left;<br>
        I left CKS because the team isn't what it used to be. When Chawi was around, the team was both more active and more productive, a friendly-environment.<br>
        After Chawi passed the team kinda fell apart.<br><br>
        It was fun, we all had a nickname over our other nicknames, three letters and a number, so that we all received credit, and none of us at the same time.<br>
        We remained anonymous to even each-other.<br>
        As a matter-of-fact, we didn't introduce ourselves to one another until after Chawi passed.<br>
        We made some weird projects, such as the now defunct CKS-E.P. (CKS Editing Program), SYSTEM-O-M4T1C and some other poggy McPog things.<br>
        But for me, the best memories made are now completely wiped from existence.<br><br>
        Chawi was a rich guy, who didn't mind sharing, who anyone could rely on, who was there when you needed him.<br>
        That said, my favorite parts of the CKS Dev Team, the CKS-E team, the CKS Digital Works team and the CKS mixing group died with him.<br>
        Chawi was rather tech-savvy, and knew how to protect his files. Some of my favorite things we worked on are saved on an external hard-drive that Chawi had, formatted beyond belief.<br>
        <a href="https://github.com/jodri-code/">V1RU5</a> attempted to recover a lot of the data Chawi had stored around, including, and not limited to <a href="https://ckstudios.itch.io/HiTWorld">HiT World</a>, the file server for <a href="http://systemware.ga">SYStemware</a>, and <a href="https://ckstudios2018.github.io/syslbot/">SYSbot</a>, but there is still loads of formatted or corrupt data.<br><br>
        These are my personal reasons for leaving the CKS Team. I hope they don't affect the other members of the team's decisions, or how you, the reader, thinks of me.<br>
