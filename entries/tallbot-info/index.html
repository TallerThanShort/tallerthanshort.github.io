    <h1>I'm Taller than a Bot</h1>
    <p id="upload-date">March 7th, 2022; Updated April 10th, 2022</p>
    <hr>
    <p>So, you've heard what I've decided to do; Leave Discord</p>
    <br>
    <p>Don't worry tho, I have left all social media platforms.</p>
    <p>Hopefully here I can clarify what some of the perms the bot used were, and why they were needed.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Permissions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>MANAGE_WEBHOOKS</li>
        <p>This is by far one of the bots most imprtant permissions. It's completely optional, yet also somewhat necessary. Let me explain: The bot needs this permission to view the webhooks and manage them, in some cases create new ones or delete old ones. The bot does this to ensure I can communicate in yer guild's individual channels. It will not abuse this tho.</p>
        <li>VIEW_CHANNELS</li>
        <p>This permission is half deprecated, used to view PUBLIC channels. I CANNOT see any private channels with this perm, besides that moderation bots ignore other bots and webhooks.</p>
        <li>READ_MESSAGES</li>
        <p>This is literally just equal to the READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY permission for members. Allows me to view messages up to 14 days old (API limit)</p>
        <li>EMBED_LINKS</li>
        <p>To have my links embed? Specially useful if ATTACH_FILES is denied, but also allows me to send ggpht.ga media via the bot.</p>
        <li>ATTACH_FILES</li>
        <p>Send media files. That's it...</p>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>I hope this clarified all of the perms the bot required to function properly. The only permission that was classed as 'elevated' is MANAGE_WEBHOOKS and, freely, you could have denied it that perm.</p>
    <p>Now to explain what the bot actually did.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Bot Workings</h3>
    <p>So, how <i>exactly</i> did TallBot work?</p>
    <ul>
        <h4>Discord Bot</h4>
        <li>Receive Messages</li>
        <p>TallBot on Discord received the messages. It could fully receive commands, reply to them using it's predefined commands, and shows me the message history (messages up to 14 days old) on a localhost version of BFC (modified to receive events from TallBot on Discord and Revolt)</p>
        <li>Manage Webhooks</li>
        <p>The bot could also manage webhooks, so that it could ensure the messages could be sent. It checked them around every 23h. If they were usuable, or available where the bot could see, it checked a box, which was viewable on the localhost site. It could also move the webhooks between channels, but needed the guild owner or a member within a guild to send me the channel ID's.</p>
        <li>Embed Media Links</li>
        <p>When I wanted to send a link, TallBot did a check to see if it matched any image CDN I used (primarily ggpht.ga, although Firebase Storage was another one), and would send the link <i>itself</i> rather than via a webhook, to ensure the media was attached, or not (depending on if you allowed it the permissions mentioned above!)</p>
        <li>Send Media</li>
        <p>Similar to the above, TallBot would also check if I was sending media (.png, .txt, .mp4, .mp3 and .m4a only), and send said media itself, rather than webhooking that data.</p>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>DO NOT INVITE THE BOT</h3>
    <p>While I haven't and won't request an account deletion, I am leaving <i>all</i> social media, including this blog. You won't hear from me online again.</p>
