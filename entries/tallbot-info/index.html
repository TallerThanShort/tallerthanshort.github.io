    <h1>I'm Taller than a Bot</h1>

    <hr>
    <p>So, you've heard what I've decided to do; Leave Discord</p>
    <br>
    <p>Don't worry tho, you will still here from me, using <a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=947043098746310656&scope=bot&permissions=537119808">TallBot</a></p>
    <br>
    <p>Hopefully here I can clarify what some of the perms the bot uses are, and why they are needed.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>MANAGE_WEBHOOKS</li>
        <p>This is by far one of the bots most imprtant permissions. It's completely optional, yet also somewhat necessary. Let me explain: The bot needs this permission to view the webhooks and manage them, in some cases create new ones or delete old ones. The bot does this to ensure I can communicate in yer guild's individual channels. It will not abuse this tho.</p>
        <li>VIEW_CHANNELS</li>
        <p>This permission is half deprecated, used to view PUBLIC channels. I CANNOT see any private channels with this perm, besides that moderation bots ignore other bots and webhooks.</p>
        <li>READ_MESSAGES</li>
        <p>This is literally just equal to the READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY permission for members. Allows me to view messages up to 14 days old (API limit)</p>
        <li>EMBED_LINKS</li>
        <p>To have my links embed? Specially useful if ATTACH_FILES is denied, but also allows me to send ggpht.ga media via the bot.</p>
        <li>ATTACH_FILES</li>
        <p>Send media files. That's it...</p>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>I hope this clarified all of the perms the bot requires to function properly. The only permission that is classed as 'elevated' is MANAGE_WEBHOOKS and, freely, you can deny it that perm.</p>
