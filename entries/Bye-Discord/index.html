    <h1>I'm Leaving Discord<br>Yes, Seriously</h1>
    <p id="upload-date">March 1st, 2022</p>
    <hr>
    <p>So, you've heard what I've been saying; I'm leaving Discord</p>
    <br>
    <p>Don't worry tho, you will still see me online in other places, like <a href="https://app.revolt.chat">Revolt</a>. This decision is personal, and because of many reasons.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Hopefully here I can clarify what some of those are.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Privacy</li>
        <p>I have a lot of privacy concerns with Discord. Even with 2FA someone was able to get into my account, because Discord prefers tokens over any form of authorisation.<br>This means that if anyone has your Discord token, they can login without the app requesting any form of verification.</p>
        <li>Their new ToS/Community Guidelines rule-out (March 28th)</li>
        <p>Their new ToS/CC dictates they can use media however they like.<br>As someone who has written a dodgy ToS/CC personally, I understand what they mean by what they are saying.</p>
        <li>Pay to Use</li>
        <p>While Discord is still free to use, many features are paid, while on an app like <a href="https://app.revolt.chat">Revolt</a> there are the same features and more, completely free!</p>
        <li>Bugs and Reporting them</li>
        <p>If memory serves me correct, Discord pulled away all of their main "Guilds" where you could freely report a bug. This simply makes reporting them harder, and I see no point in making an end-user experience any harder.</p>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>With all of that said, I hope not to bother anyone with leaving the service. My guilds will still be available, with their icons, but a lot of media I uploaded myself has been removed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Unfortunately, this does mean I will be leaving Top.gg also</p>
