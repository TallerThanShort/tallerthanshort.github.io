    <p>Elo and welcum to (what was) me blog. <br>
        I <i>was</i> TTS, a complete unnutter idiot, who liked to code sometimes. <br>
            This site had my blog posts on it, but the general <a href="https://tallerthanshort.github.io/about-me/">about me site</a> 
                is where you could have found out more about me. <br>
                    Compared to some other blogs hosted on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub.com</a>, my blog was to be written in HTML, CSS and JS - <b>NOT JEKYLL!</b>
