    <h1>Did I <i>lie?</i></h1>

    <h4>Elo there. I'm TTS (TallerThanShort - aka CKS3)</h4>
    <p>For those of ye that don't know me, it's a pleasure to make yer acquaintance. For those of ye who don't want to be acquainted with a liar... same really.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So... What did I lie about?</p>
    <p>tbh it's not really a lie... Basically, I'm not a programmer/coder/developer. I have no clue what I'm doing 99% of the time. Apparently tho, some people think I am somehow a Web Developer and general JS/C programmer. I'm sorry if that was the impression I caused you.</p>
    <p>I will be editing my about me site, all of my about me sections on social media, and other things because of this.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>So, if I'm not a programmer/coder/developer - what <i>am</i> I?</h4>
    <p>tbh, I'm an animator. I made the SYScube entry animation, and I'm probably the only reason V1RU5 added SYScube (3d animation software) to SYStemware in the first place. I'm also a bit of a Photoshop guy. I like to make weird stuff sometimes. I can also make some things work in HTML, CSS, JS, C/Cpp/C# etc... But, that's not what I'm anywhere near <i>good</i> at.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I mean, I only just learnt what the damn "i" tag does (I probably already knew, but forgot). I don't know how to make text bold in html, so I'm using header tags instead. I don't know how to move a goddamn div, and I can't for the life of me make a nav bar work.</p>
    <p>And then there's JS. <i>Yes</i> I made SYS4Revolt work (Revolt.js, ESM) and yes I made Waifu (Discord.js@12.4.1, CJS), but we shouldn't even count Waifu since it was made following a tutorial on YouTube.</p>
    <br>
    <p>With all of that said, I'm still down for learning shtuff. I would love to someday move my div's, make nav bar's work how I intend and maybe even finish Crispy (or at least, <i>Nightly</i>) - but I don't see any of those soon.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Oh, and one last thing:</h3>
    <p>tysm 6, 8, rus, Alkazar, Bye and anyone else for having my back and helping with some of the dumbass requests I've asked.</p>
